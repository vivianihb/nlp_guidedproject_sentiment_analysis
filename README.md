# nlp_guidedproject_sentiment_analysis
A guided Natural Language Processing project analysing the sentiments of Amazon reviews

This was a guided project intended on importing a data set, exploring, and cleaning it, in order to be used to train AI/ML models to access the feelings of customers who reviewed a certain product in Amazon.

The files should be run in the following order:

1) import data
2) explore data
3) word cloud
4) data cleaning
